# Deep-Learning-Artwork-Recgnition-System-
### Build an artwork recognition system using deep learning framework as TensorFlow and Keras

* Preprocess 5-gb image datasets "data.csv", resize data and preprare for advance training, "processed_dataset.csv" 
* Build Cosine Similarity matrix using VGG-16 pre-trained models, find the correspondingly most similar artworks, "paiting_tf_code.ipnb"
* Use pretrained Resnet50 model to train the model and evaluate the final result of 96% accuracy, "paiting_tf_code.ipnb".

* please see the original image datasets at "https://www.kaggle.com/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time"
