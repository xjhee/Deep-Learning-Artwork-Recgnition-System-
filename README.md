# Deep-Learning-Artwork-Recgnition-System-
### Build an artwork recognition system using deep learning framework as TensorFlow and Keras

1. Preprocess 5-gb image datasets "data.csv", resize data and preprare for advance training, "datasets.csv" 
2. Build Cosine Similarity matrix using VGG-16 pre-trained models, find the correspondingly most similar artworks, "paiting_tf_code.ipnb"
3. Use pretrained Resnet50 model to train the model and evaluate the final result of 96% accuracy, "paiting_tf_code.ipnb".
